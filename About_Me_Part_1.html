    <p><strong>Listening</strong> is a strength that has allowed me to see past obstacles that would have caused me great hindrances. Listening will enable you to gather information, decipher the necessary components, retain information vital to the conversation, and offer feedback if required. The person listening sees your interest, and this could be the start or maintenance of a relationship. It's satisfying, like eating <em>ice cream</em>!
